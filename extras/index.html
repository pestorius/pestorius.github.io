      <h2 class="underline">Random Stuff I've Been Learning</h2>
      <h3 class="italic">Ukulele</h3>
      <p>Ukuleles are relatively easy to learn so I decided to dedicate some time to learning it. I spent
      around a month learning the basics of the ukulele, which involved learning how to tune, strum, and
      play some songs with the basic chords. I learned all this from a website that consisted of 3 
      easy-to-follow 
      <a class="new-tab" href="https://willgrovewhite.com/learning-to-play-the-ukulele-lesson-one/" title="Link to lessons">
      lessons</a> composed by Will Grove White. I wouldn't say I'm amazing at playing the ukulele, but my
      knowledge for now is fairly basic.</p>
      <h3 class="italic">Android Development</h3>
      <p>I took a course in android application development in the fall of 2017, and it helped me discover
      my love for software engineering. After that I've always wanted to create a simple app that I could
      build and publish on the Play Store. My dad suggested I create an app for his business, so I spent
      most of the summer building, publishing, and maintaining the app. It does not have many downloads
      because it's simply a neat looking catalogue, but it was a great way to practice my software development
      skills.</p>
      <h3 class="italic">Rubik's Cube</h3>
      <p>A relatively simple but fun skill to show off to peers. I learned to solve the Rubik's Cube through
      a Youtube video that taught the concepts and "algorithms" needed to easily solve the puzzle.</p>

      <section id="photography-container">
        <p id="photography-paragraph">Whenever I'm outside I have my phone ready to take pictures
        of anything I find interesting or "Instagram worthy". I enjoy taking pictures of beautifull
        sceneries and structures. I do not own a professional camera, and probably do not plan on 
        owning one any time soon because I'm not too much into photography for now.</p>
