      <h1 id="first-header">About Me</h1>
      <p>Travelling from the other side of the globe, I have come a far way from Malaysia to 
      achieve my goals and explore new opportunities in Chicago. I began my journey in Oakton Community 
      College, where I dived into the basics of Computer Science. 2 years later I transferred 
      to Illinois Institute of Technology to pursue my Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science. I 
      am currently an Illinois Institute of Technology alumni, and I have gained a vast knowledge 
      of techniques and practices in Computer Science and related fields. Shortly after graduation
      I started work as a Software Test Engineer/Automation Developer at BAE Systems Applied Intelligence
      in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.</p>
      <p>In my spare time I enjoy learning new skills to benefit me in my job or to expand my general skillset.
      It's basically a hobby to have an array of hobbies. These aren't extraordinary skills, but they're
      skills that are simple and easy to learn. I've written about a few of them in the extras page.</p>

      <h1>What I'm Up To</h1>
      <p>Now that I'm working full time at BAE Systems, there's less time to work on my hobbies. I'm currently 
      learning how to play the keyboard and I've been spending a few hours on the weekends planning on a new mobile
      app I want to develop. This idea is bigger than any app I've worked on by myself so lots of planning and 
      analysis is needed.</p>
