      <h1 id="first-header">About Me</h1>
      <p>Travelling from the other side of the globe, I have come a far way from Malaysia to 
      achieve my goals and explore new opportunities in Chicago. I began my journey in Oakton Community 
      College, where I dived into the basics of Computer Science. 2 years later I transferred 
      to Illinois Institute of Technology to pursue my Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science. I 
      am currently an Illinois Institute of Technology alumni, and I have gained a vast knowledge 
      of techniques and practices in Computer Science and related fields. Shortly after graduation
      I started work as a Software Test Engineer/Automation Developer at BAE Systems Applied Intelligence
      in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.</p>

      <h1>What I've Done</h1>
      <h2 class="underline">Summer of 2018</h2>
      <p>I've been spending most of my summer breaks in Malaysia since I began studying in the states.
      It's a great chance for me to unwind and be as lazy as I want, but I try to be productive as well.
      I use this free time to learn some new skills or use the skills I already have to build something.</p>
      <h3 class="italic">Ukulele</h3>
      <p>Ukuleles are relatively easier to learn so I decided to dedicate some time from my summer
      to learn it. I spent around a month learning the basics of the ukulele, which involved learning
      how to tune, strum, and play some songs with the easier chords.</p>
      <p>I learned all this from a website that consisted of 3 easy-to-follow 
      <a class="new-tab" href="https://willgrovewhite.com/learning-to-play-the-ukulele-lesson-one/" title="Link to lessons">
      lessons</a> composed by Will Grove White. I wouldn't say I'm amazing at playing the
      ukulele, but my knowledge for now is fairly basic.</p>
      <h3 class="italic">Android Development</h3>
      <p>I took a course in android application development in the fall of 2017, and it helped me discover
      my love for software engineering. After that I've always wanted to create a simple app that I could
      build and publish on the Play Store. My dad suggested I create an app for his business, so I spent
      most of the summer building, publishing, and maintaining the app. It does not have many downloads
      because it's simply a neat looking catalogue, but it was a great way to practice my software development
      skills.</p>

      <h1>What I'm Up To</h1>
      <h2 class="underline">Fall of 2018</h2>
      <p>During my semesters at Illinois Institute of Technology I don't have a great amount of free time
      to learn many new skills or practice existing ones, but this semester I'm working (possibly) with
      IIT's public safety department to improve and implement an app I worked on in my android app development
      class which I have written about in the <a href="./projects/" title="Jump to project">projects</a>
      section. I have proposed the idea of the app to public safety and they seem to be interested but I would have to
      show improvement in the design and functionality before they can decide if they want to use the app.</p>

      <h1>What I Plan To Do</h1>
      <p>I was able to secure a job as a software engineer at BAE Systems Applied Intelligence in Malaysia for 
      when after I graduate. Although I'll be preoccupied with my job, I plan to keep on working on new skills 
      as an escape from what I do from 9 to 5.</p>
      <h3 class="italic">App Development</h3>
      <p>I know, this isn't much of an escape because it is indeed software engineering, but for now it is a
      passion and as long as I have ideas for an app I'm going to have that urge to create. In fact, I might 
      have to continue developing and maintaining the IITSecurity app if needed. If IITSecurity gets the green
      light by Illinois Tech's Public Safety Department, I would have to work remotely with my team to develop
      the app for iOS as well.</p>
      <h3>More skills I plan to learn:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Solve the Rubik's Cube</li>
        <li>Basic violin</li>
        <li>Music editing</li>
        <li>Basic skateboarding</li>
        <li>3D drawing</li>
      </ul>
